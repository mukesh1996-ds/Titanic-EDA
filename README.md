# Titanic-EDA
In this repository I am working on titanic data and applying all the EDA techniques.

### Dataset exploring 

The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster.

Our task is to preform EDA based on our observation. 
Let's first see the data column:

1. survival	    Survival	    0 = No, 1 = Yes
2. pclass	    Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
3. sex	        Sex	
4. Age	        Age in years	
5. sibsp	    # of siblings / spouses aboard the 
                            sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
                            Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
                            Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

6.  parch	     # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
                            parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
                            Parent = mother, father
                            Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
                            Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.	

7.  ticket	    Ticket number	
8.  fare	    Passenger fare	
9.  cabin	    Cabin number	
10. embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
11. alive      Alive person on ship
12. alone      Travelling alone on ship
